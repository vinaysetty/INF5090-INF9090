\section{Introduction}
In our assignment we were to use the Real-time Application Mobility Platform (TRAMP). This is a project developed by the Distributed Multimedia Systems (DMMS) group at the University of Oslo.

This is a assignment given to us in the course INF5090 - Advanced Topics in Distributed Systems which is a course given by the University of Oslo, as well as Lancaster University in England and University of Mannheim in Germany. The teachers are Thomas Plagemann and Vera Goebel with their teaching assistants Piotr Kaminski and Hans Vatne Hansen. These are also the people that developed the TRAMP framework together with some other developers all from the University of Oslo.

The TRAMP project was started in late 2011, the goal of the framework is to ``make a migration system for real-time applications, such as Spotify and Skype, where users can take applications with them when they move.'' \cite{TRAMP-homepage}

Lets say you sit on your computer talking to a friend on skype. You need to go, but you got more to say to him/her. TRAMP will let you stream the conversation to your phone seamlessly and when you get to work, you can then transfer the conversation to your work computer.
